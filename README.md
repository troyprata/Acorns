# Acorns


**What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?**

Acorns is a financial technology and services company based on passive investing. It was founded in 2012 in order to encourage people to have incremental savings and investments when spending money. Every purchase made while using acorns is rounded up to the nearest dollar, with that remaining amount put into selected portfolios. Their competitors include Betterment, Robinhood, M1 Finance, and Digit. 


**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

The company uses the convenience of mobile apps in order to help newly investors start building their portfolio.They are considered a fintech company since they operate completely within the digital domain of Finance.


**Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses? **

It uses robo-advising as well as machine learning.Its an app that is very easy to use and very convenient.  It automatically invests your money into either short term or long term investments creating diversified portfolios for the individual using the service. Anyone can start investing with little to information on how to or where to invest their money. Some weaknesses are expensive fees and tailored more towards people who are forcing themselves to invest and save.


**What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?**

I expect acorns to continue to grow due to the accessibility of it and will continue to be one of the top robo-advising apps in the fintech world.
